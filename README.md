# Spotify-Music-Recommendation-App
This application is a part of our CS492 Mobile Development class. This app will serve as a music recommendation app where the user will be able to input information describing how they are feeling and the application will curate a list of songs, albums, and artists that best match what the user describes using Spotify's API. The user will be able to listen to the music, view the songâ€™s info, and share the song with friends.
